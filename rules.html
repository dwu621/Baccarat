        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <p>For each coup, two cards are dealt face up to each hand, starting from "player" and alternating between the hands. If either the player or banker or both achieve a total of 8 or 9 at this stage, the coup is finished and the result is announced: a player win, a banker win, or tie. If neither hand has eight or nine, the drawing rules are applied to determine whether the player should receive a third card. Then, based on the value of any card drawn to the player, the drawing rules are applied to determine whether the banker should receive a third card. The coup is then finished, the outcome is announced, and winning bets are paid out.</p>
        
        <h2>Tableau of drawing rules</h2>
        <p>If neither the player nor the banker is dealt a total of 8 or 9 in the first two cards (known as a "natural"), the tableau is consulted, first for the player's rules, then the banker's.</p>
        
        <h2>Player's rule</h2>
        <p>If the player has an initial total of 0 to 5, they draw a third card. If the player has an initial total of 6 or 7, they stand.</p>
       
        <h2>Banker's rule</h2>
        <p>If the player stood pat (i.e., has only two cards), the banker regards only their own hand and acts according to the same rule as the player, that is the banker draws a third card with hands 0 to 5 and stands with 6 or 7.</p>
         <ul>
             <p>If the player drew a third card, the banker acts according to the following more complex rules:</p>
             <li>
                If the banker total is 2 or less, then the banker draws a card, regardless of what the player's third card is.
             </li>
             <li>
                If the banker total is 3, then the banker draws a third card unless the player's third card was an 8.
             </li>
             <li>
                If the banker total is 4, then the banker draws a third card if the player's third card was 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
             </li>
             <li>
                If the banker total is 5, then the banker draws a third card if the player's third card was 4, 5, 6, or 7.
             </li>
             <li>
                If the banker total is 6, then the banker draws a third card if the player's third card was a 6 or 7.
             </li>
             <li>
                If the banker total is 7, then the banker stands.
             </li>

         </ul>
